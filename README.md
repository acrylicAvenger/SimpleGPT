# SimpleGPT

This repository contains a simple implementation of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model. GPT is a state-of-the-art language model that uses the transformer architecture and pre-training techniques to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

#Features
Easy-to-use: The implementation provides a simple and straightforward interface for utilizing the GPT model.
Lightweight: The model has been designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for various applications and devices.
Pre-trained Weights: We provide pre-trained weights for the GPT model, enabling immediate text generation without the need for extensive training.
Customizability: The codebase allows for easy customization and extension, allowing you to adapt the model to your specific needs.
